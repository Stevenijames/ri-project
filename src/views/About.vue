    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a longtime Davie resident and graduate of Davie High School Class of
      05'. I currently work as Clerk of Superior Court for Iredell County and
      have enjoyed the process and specifications for running the ins and outs
      of the court. My goal is to continue use my skills of organization and be
      a asset to the Davie County court system.
